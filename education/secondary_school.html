    <h1>Mr. Froggy Introduction</h1>
    <br>
    <p>(abbreviated as SMA DMW) (دائرة المعارف الوطنية transliterated as: Dāʾirat al-Maʿārif al-Waṭaniyyah), is an Islamic and Arabic educational school located at Jalan Perak, 13200, Kepala Batas, Seberang Perai Utara, Penang, Peninsular Malaysia. It was established in 1926 CE. Other religious schools at that time included Madrasah Irsyad al-Ashraf al-Wataniah, Sungai Bakap, Penang, and Madrasah Idrisiah, Bukit Chandan, Kuala Kangsar, Perak.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The founder, Shaykh Abdullah Fahim, originally named Abdullah bin Ibrahim bin Tahir, was also known as Haji Abdullah Pak Him. Pak Him is an abbreviation of his father's name, Ibrahim. The term 'Fahim' is derived from Arabic, meaning 'a person who understands'. He was born in Mecca in 1286 AH / 1869 CE, and passed away on 12 Zulkaedah 1380 AH / 27 April 1961 CE in Seberang Perai, Penang. Abdullah Fahim received his basic traditional education from his own father, Haji Ibrahim bin Tahir, in Mecca.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Abdullah Fahim was among the scholars proficient in the science of astronomy. Therefore, his opinion was sought to determine the appropriate date for Malaya's independence. Based on Shaykh Abdullah Fahim's calculations and astronomy, it was determined that Malaya's independence day would fall on 31 August 1957.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Form 1 and 2: Transition and Exploration</p>
    <br>
    <p>Entering Sekolah Menengah Agama Daeratul Maarifil Wataniah, Ahmad Yusuf faced a new environment and higher academic expectations. In Form 1, he adjusted to the rigorous curriculum that balanced religious studies with general education. He quickly adapted, excelling in subjects such as Arabic, Quranic studies, and Islamic history, while maintaining strong performances in Mathematics and Science.</p>
    <p>Ahmad joined the school's nasyid (Islamic vocal music) group, where he discovered a passion for performing arts. His participation in the group's performances at school events helped him build confidence and public speaking skills. He also joined the school’s archery club, enjoying the sport and developing focus and precision.</p>
    <p>In Form 2, Ahmad’s interest in religious studies deepened. He began attending additional classes on tafsir (Quranic exegesis) and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). His academic diligence was recognized, and he was often called upon to lead prayers and recitations during school assemblies. Outside the classroom, he continued to be an active member of the nasyid group and represented his school in regional competitions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Form 3 and 4: Leadership and Academic Pursuits</p>
    <br>
    <p>Form 3 marked an important milestone with the PT3 (Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3) examinations. Ahmad balanced his time between studying for his exams and participating in extracurricular activities. His hard work paid off when he achieved outstanding results, particularly in Islamic Studies, Mathematics, and Science.</p>
    <p>Building on his academic success, Ahmad was elected as the vice president of the Islamic Society in Form 4. In this role, he organized study circles, religious talks, and community service projects, such as visiting orphanages and organizing food drives during Ramadan. His leadership skills flourished, and he became a respected figure among his peers.</p>
    <p>Academically, Ahmad developed a keen interest in Biology and Chemistry, considering a future career in medicine. He attended science fairs and participated in the school’s biology club, conducting experiments and learning about the latest advancements in medical science. His dedication to both his religious and academic education set him apart as a well-rounded student.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Form 5: Preparation and Achievement</p>
    <br>
    <p>Form 5 was a challenging year as Ahmad prepared for the SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia) examinations. He set high academic goals and dedicated himself to a rigorous study schedule. His efforts were supported by his teachers, who provided additional tutoring and guidance.</p>
    <p>In addition to his studies, Ahmad continued to fulfill his duties as a student leader. He was elected as the head prefect, a role in which he mentored younger students, organized school events, and ensured discipline within the school. Ahmad also led the school’s participation in interfaith dialogues, promoting mutual understanding and respect among students of different religious backgrounds.</p>
    <p>Ahmad’s hard work culminated in exceptional SPM results. He scored straight A's, with top marks in Islamic Studies, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics. His achievements were celebrated by his family, teachers, and peers, who recognized his dedication and perseverance.</p>
